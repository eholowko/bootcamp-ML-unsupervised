The results ofthis research will provide new understanding to the mechanism ofthe thermal reactions of small-ring hydrocarbons. The shock tubemethod will allow high reaction temperatures to be reached (1100K) without the complication of reaction on the reactor wall. Newand sophisticated spectroscopic methods will be used to detectintermediates in these reactions, and from this analysis aninsight to the mechanism of the reaction can be reached.The isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small-ringhydrocarbons will be studied by shock tube and static reactortechniques. Mechanistic details of these reactions will be probedwith state of the art spectroscopic techniques, namely, highresolution IR absorption spectroscopy, tunable diode lasermethods, and vibrational circular dichroism. Sophisticateddeuterium and carbon-13 labeling experiments will be employed todetermine the course of reaction. From these experiments it willbe possible to determine if these reactions proceed in aconcerted or stepwise manner, and if orbital symmetry rules areobeyed.\\n'"
